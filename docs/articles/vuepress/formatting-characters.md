# Formatting characters in Markdown


Markdown uses character formatting conventions you're probably familiar with already.
That's by design, since it was meant to mimic what we already do 
when we use plain text but want to emphasize things.

## Bold text in Markdown

To make text bold, surround it with `**` on each side. Avoid spaces.

##### Markdown:

```
You never expected a **Spanish Inquisition!**
```

##### Results:

You never expected a **Spanish Inquisition!**

## Italic text in Markdown

To make text italic, surround it with `_` on each side. Avoid spaces.

##### Markdown:

```
Robert left his space suit at the cleaners. _What will NASA say?_
```

##### Results:

Robert left his space suit at the cleaners. _What will NASA say?_

## Monospaced text in Markdown

To use a monospaced font, surround it with `` ` `` on each side. Avoid spaces.

##### Markdown:

```
The killer computer displayed a frightening message: `hello, world.`
```

##### Results:

The killer computer displayed a frightening message: `hello, world.`

## Strikethough text in Markdown

To show strikethrough text, surround it with two tildes (`~~`) on each side. Avoid spaces.

##### Markdown:

```
Your children are ~~not very~~ well informed.
```

##### Results:

Your children are ~~not very~~ well informed.
