## Creating documentation sites fast with VuePress


##### Step-by-step instructions that take you through the complete process with nothing left out

#### by **Tom Campbell**

[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) lets you create beautiful,
searchable, high-performance static websites using simple Markdown
documents. And while VuePress can be daunting to learn from the
[official documents](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/tree/master/packages/%40vuepress/core), there's actually only a few things you need
to get a robust site running. 

This [VuePress tutorial](create-home-page.md) 
takes you through those steps keystroke by keystroke, 
and explains briefly why 
you do what you do each step of the way.
