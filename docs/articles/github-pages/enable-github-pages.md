# Enable GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hasn't been enabled yet.
Doing so will let you apply the powers of Jekyll to the markup files you've created.

* Choose the **Settings** gear icon for your repository near the upper right of the page.

![The Settings icon for your repo is near the upper right of the page](/assets/img/find-settings-icon.png)

The **Settings** page appears.

* Scroll down to the section called **GitHub Pages**

You'll see **Source** subheading and a button that says **None**.

![Choose the None button, then choose master branch/docs folder](/assets/img/find-github-pages-setting.png)


* For **Source**, choose **master branch /docs folder**.

Voil√†! That's all you need to do.

Almost immediately, a message and new link appear under **GitHub Pages** showing where your published site appears.
