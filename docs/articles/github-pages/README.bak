# Creating a GitHub Account

You only need to do this once:

* First [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join). It's free.

Your GitHub account is allowed unlimited public projects.
This guide shows how to create a GitHub Pages site from a public project.

# Creating a repository for your projects

* Choose the **+** symbol, then **New repository** (or just click this [Create new repository](https://github.com/new) link).

The **Create a new repository** page appears.

On some configurations you may see the **Start a project** button, so click it if so.

* Give the repository a name. Normally it's best to use lowercase letters, numbers. Instead of spaces and hyphen characters (the minus sign, or `-`) instead. It will be used as a filename, and it will be given prominence in Web searches.

* Leave **Public** checked, then choose **Create repository**. Feel free to add a descripion if you wish.

# Creating the first page at /docs/README.md 

The first thing needed is to create a file named specifically `README.md` capitalized exactly as shown, 
and it must go in a directory named `/docs`. Sites like the one you're creating with GitHub Pages often accompany
code for a software project and `/docs` is the logical location.

Jekyll also expects your text to be in that directory as well.

GitHub pages sites use directory structures. Each subdirectory with pages you want published must contain
a README.md file, which will be silently converted to `index.html` files.

* Under **Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before** it says
`Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore`. Choose the `creating a new file` link:

![Creating a new repository](/assets/img/github-quick-setup.png)

* Enter `docs/README.md` and you'll see how GitHub separates the path and filename
interactively, visually distinguishing each level of the directory
hierarchy:

![Each slash creates a new directory](/assets/img/github-enter-directory-slash-filename.png)

All GitHub Pages directories with files meant to appear in the website
must have a file named `README.md` in them.

## All pages have headers and text

Create a page that looks something like this. It doesn't matter what you write,
as long as you start the first line with a hash tag and a space, like so: `# `

```
# Please start here

Thanks for using our product.
```

The `# ` signfies a level 1 header. The text underneath it is plain text.

Let's call this page done for now. 

* At the bottom of the page choose **Commit new file**.

You can optionally put a brief note in the top line (50 characters or less by convention)
and a longer explanation under it.

Github shows the page rendered as HTML:

![Your first README.md](/assets/img/github-pages-first-readme.png)

## Set master branch to /docs folder 

GitHub Pages and Jekyll prefer you to use a directory structure 
starting not in the root directory but in `/docs`. Inserting `/docs`
before in a path can get old. GitHub lets you avoid this by establishing it
as the base directory for your documentation site.

* From the list of sections on the middle of the page choose **Settings**:

![Choose the Settings tab](/assets/img/github-settings-tab.png)

* Find the section named **GitHub Pages**, and choose  **Source**.

* Choose **master branch /docs folder**.

Changing the master branch to `/docs` means you will be able to avoid specifying the `/docs` folder at the base of every link.

## Your site is now on GitHub Pages at github.io

A new message appears above it in the **GitHub Pages** section, saying **Your site is ready to be published at ...**, 
followed by a link. 

```
✓ Your site is published https://tomcam.github.io/gh/
```

As you can see, there's a pattern. A github project at `https://github.com/mycoolname/bigdocument` appears
on `https://mycoolname.github.io/bigdocument`

## Open the page in GitHub pages

* Open that link in a new browser tab:

![Opening your site in GitHub Pages](/assets/img/github-pages-opened.png)

Congratulations. Your source code is now being run through Jekyll 
at GitHub. You can edit it using GitHub's interactive editor, and
Jekyll is automatically run when the source code changes.
